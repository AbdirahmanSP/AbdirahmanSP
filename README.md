- 👋 Hi, anybody who sees this, my name is Abdirahman. You may know me as Souplike or SP, but honestly, you can call me anything you want. 
- 👀 I love doing things. Gaming, conversions, you can name it. Love collaborating and talking to people. Fascinated with ROM hacking and assembly code. I love all sorts of franchises (if it isn't bad).
- 🌱 I'm a modder... if you didn't know but I'm currently learning how to mod Sonic Superstars, cause why not?
- 📫 If you want to reach me, I honestly don't really have anything other than Discord at the moment with @rereremix. I'm thinking about making a new Twitter account, but you know why I'm hesitant (The name X sucks).
