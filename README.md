- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, anybody who sees this, my name is Abdirahman. You may know me as Souplike or SP, but honestly, you can call me anything you want. 
- ðŸ‘€ I love doing things. Gaming, conversions, you can name it. Love collaborating and talking to people. Fascinated with ROM hacking and assembly code. I love all sorts of franchises (if it isn't bad).
- ðŸŒ± I'm just learning how to mod 
- ðŸ“« If you want to reach me, I honestly don't really have anything other than Discord at the moment with @rereremix. I'm thinking about making an new Twitter account, but you know why I'm hesistant (The name X sucks).
